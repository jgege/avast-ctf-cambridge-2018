 Welcome legionary!

 We have to track and destroy the enemy spy ring. They have a mystical
 God artifact and can see our troops and ships from the sky.
 Traces as to where the enemies could be lead to Syracuse, Carthage 
 and Alexandria. 

 We find a dead spy on our way to Syracuse with strange messages.
 The first message is only a pile of numbers. The second is also very weird.

 Try to find path a to take to get to the God artifact and remember, 
 there are many legionaries also going after the artifact, 
 but there can only be one winner!

 Try to decode the enemy message to continue to Syracuse.
