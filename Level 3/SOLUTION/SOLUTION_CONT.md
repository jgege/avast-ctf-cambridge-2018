There are two main ways to approach the situation: we can use a x86 emulator (e.g. [Unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/)), or use a debugger to hijack any program's execution flow and replace its instructions with the ones given in our dump. I found the latter method a lot more fun, and even potentially faster, so in this solution we will stick to it.

The first step is to find a debugger. I use **Windows**, so I settled for the powerful [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com).

Now, we have to convert the dump to plain bytes. I did this by hand, and separated the **hex dump** and **memory dump** like this:

Hex dump (starts at **0x00401000**):
```
31 C0 B0 40 C1 E0 10 80 F4 20 FF D0 50 8A 50 03 30 54 01 04 FE C1 80 F9 64 75 F5 80 E9 5F 00 C8 FF D0 F4
```

Memory dump (starts at **0x00402000**):
```
31 C9 C3 C0 1E 40 2C D0 3E 80 CA 41 B0 CB C0 C0 C9 DA 40 A8 D3 DA 40 A8 D8 F3 F0 00 90 03 2F D7 94 4A 1F 00 9E EC 3A 97 DD 9E D9 EE AD 3C 96 0D E0 DF 9E E7 32 6B F7 D8 1D EA E1 CD 6A 7E 6F 04 0A 0A 0A 0B 0A 0A 0A 0B 02 0B 7C 0A 0A 0A 0B 0A 0A 79 0C 0B 0D 0C 09 03 03 79 0A 7F 02 7C 7F 03 7F 0B 7C 08 03 79 0A 7F 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

Next, we have to find ourselves some executable space. We start up `x32dbg` (not `x64dbg`, since we are working with `x32` code), and open any `32-bit` executable. Let's use `x32dbg.exe` itself.

The process initializes, and we stop at the `System breakpoint`:

We now have to insert our first dump at the `origin` (current execution point) using `Ctrl+Shift+V`, or `right-click > Binary > Paste (Ignore Size)`. We end up with the following block of instructions:

![](https://i.imgur.com/abVIW5K.png)

Now, it is **very** important to paste the **hex dump** and **memory dump** bytes exactly **0xFDE** bytes apart (distance between **0x00402000** and **0x00401022**), so the original structure is intact. The easiest way to do so is selecting the last instruction of the first block (`HALT`), pressing `Ctrl+G` or `Go to > Expression`, and appending `+FDE`. For me the field is: `7714DB02+FDE`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/UMa97ky.png)

This will lead us to the exact location where we should paste the second dump. After pasting it looks like this: (end trimmed in screenshot)

![](https://i.imgur.com/nbV0RZh.png)

We note the beginning address of this block - `7714EAE0` - for reference, and go back to the origin (`Numpad *`). 

Now, we step through the first instructions, until we reach `CALL EAX`:

![](https://i.imgur.com/FkqYNeI.png)

We look at the `EAX` register: it is `00402000`. Does that ring a bell? This is the address of the second block (check the original dump). In our case, however, this address is invalid, and we have to replace it with the real address we wrote down a moment ago. We `double-click` on the register value and change it. For me that was `7714EAE0`. We `step into` the call and continue `stepping over`, until we are back in our first block.

Now comes a tricky bit. Notice the following instruction:



![](https://i.imgur.com/eZcyMGq.png)

It replaces the byte at a given address. This isn't usually a problem, but in our case it will raise an exception. The reason is that we are currently in the `.text` section, which is executable code, and it cannot be overwritten! To fix this, we have to select the memory pages that correspond to this section and mark them all as `FULL ACCESS`, or at least give them `WRITE ACCESS`.

In x64dbg we do this by `right-clicking the above instruction > Follow in Memory Map`. We then `right-click the highlighted page > Set Page Memory Rights > Select All > FULL ACCESS > Set Rights` and close the window.

We can now return to the `CPU` tab.

Before we continue, we analyze the following instructions:

![](https://i.imgur.com/eORohVk.png)

While not necessary, we can deduce that this is essentially a **XOR decryption** loop.
The code enclosed between `7714DAF0` - `7714DAF9` will loop for **0xC0** times, or **192**. Surely we won't want to `step over` that manually, so we select the instruction after the jump (`sub cl,5F`), and press `F2` or `right-click > Breakpoint > Toggle`) to place a breakpoint. Now `Run` the program (`F9`). When we break, we `step in` the next few instructions, until we jump to the second block, which is now decrypted.

We see the following instructions:

![](https://i.imgur.com/F7YvFii.png)

Clearly even more decryption? If we check `EAX+A` we see that it leads to the code in the first block! 
Pay attention to the end of this routine: a combination of `PUSH` + `RET` becomes a `JMP`, since the `RET` returns to the value on top of the stack, and here that is the value `PUSH` just pushed (`EAX`). 

Another tricky bit is the `XOR` instructon just before that. In terms of the original dump, this will set the last two bits of the address to `0`, and so land at the beginning of the **hex dump block** (`00401000`). In our case, however, this `XOR` will mess things up, since our (real) address doesn't end with `00`. To fix this, we `step in` until we reach the `PUSH` instruction, and then change `EAX` to the address of the first instruction of the first block (`7714DAE0` for me).

We `step over` the `PUSH` and `RET` instructions and we land back at the first block.
Again, we look at the code:

![](https://i.imgur.com/A4Qurzd.png)

We already know what these instructions do. `Step over` to `CALL EAX`, change `EAX` to the address of the second block (`7714EAE0`), `step in` once to land at the second block, then `step over` until you come back in the first block.

Now, we examine the code:

![](https://i.imgur.com/bcZZ6XX.png)

Same decryption, with a different XOR value. We breakpoint directly on the `CALL EAX`, `Run` (`F9`), and `step in` once. We land at the second block.

We now analyze the final routine in this binary challenge:

![](https://i.imgur.com/LUXVUKr.png)

By carefully reading the instructions, we notice something unusual: the byte at `EBX` is overwritten every time in the loop, and in the end even overwritten with `F4`, which in turn will end the program execution. It is therefore safe to bet that the values of `EBX` (or `DL`) will be interesting for us.

To log these values, we set a breakpoint at our point of interest (`mov byte ptr ds:[ebx],dl`). We then head to the `Breakpoints` tab, find our breakpoint, and `right-click > Edit`. We can now specify a `Log Text`, which will be logged every time x64dbg executes this instruction. In our case, we want it to log the value of `DL`, so we set `Log Text` to: `{DL}`. String formatting occurs inside the curly brackets, where you can insert an [expression](http://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/introduction/Expressions.html). The expression here is the `DL` register. We also set the `Break Condition` to `0`, so we only log, and not break.

For more information about string formatting, check the [documentation](https://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/Expressions.html).

We go back to the `CPU` tab and put an extra breakpoint on the instruction after the `JNE` (`mov byte ptr ds:[ebx],F4`).

![](https://i.imgur.com/fGMXThd.png)

We `Run` the program and land at the second breakpoint.

We now head to the `Log` tab and write down the logged bytes:

![](https://i.imgur.com/izQoAJI.png)

We get:
```
50 44 55 3E 30 30 30 31 30 30 30 31 38 31 46 30 30 30 31 30 30 43 36 31 37 36 33 39 39 43 30 45 38 46 45 39 45 31 46 32 39 43 30 45
```

Hurray, the binary 'evil' has been defeated! Head over to the [last part of the solution](SOLUTION_CONT2.md) to see how to complete the challenge.
